***Purpose*** : Predict sales volume in EU.

***Motivation*** : Different regions have different laws protecting gamers from various malicious game features (i.e. some countries have prohibited "Loot Boxes" by trying to protect the younger audience from gambling in video games). Gamers from different regions have different perspectives on video games. Releasing games might not always be profitable in some regions, for example, many of different South Korea titles are unsuccessful in the western market because of their predatory real money in game purchases a.k.a pay2win. 

***Dataset***: [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) by [GregorySmith](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut)

## Project Objectives

1. Complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);
2. Experiment with different data visualisation techniques;
3. Create data preparation pipeline that is reusable;
4. Experiment with various machine learning models;
5. Train the beest machine learning model from previous objective;
6. Save model so that it could be reused later;
7. Create a notebook combining data preparation pipeline and saved model;
8. Export final notebook as Python script.

## Project Results

1. Four notebooks: EDA, Data preparation, Model creation, Combined prediction pipeline;
2. Python script for running predictive model on given data;
3. Saved pipeline and final model.
